            <strong>Clube de Regatas do Flamengo</strong>, more commonly
            referred to as simply Flamengo, is a Brazilian sports club based in
            Rio de Janeiro, in the neighborhood of Gávea, best known for their
            professional football team that plays in Campeonato Brasileiro Série
            A, as well as Campeonato Carioca.
          </p>
          <p>
            The club was first established in 1895 specifically as a rowing club
            and did not play their first official football match until 1912.
            Flamengo's traditional uniform features red and black striped shirts
            with white shorts, and red and black striped socks. Flamengo has
            typically played their home matches in the Maracanã, the national
            stadium of Brazil, since its completion in 1950, with some
            exceptions in recent years. Since 1969, the vulture (Portuguese:
            <i>urubu</i>) has been the most recognized mascot of Flamengo.
          </p>
          <p>
            Flamengo established themselves as one of Brazil's most successful
            sports clubs in the 20th century during the era of state leagues in
            Brazil when they captured several Campeonato Carioca (Rio de Janeiro
            state league) titles prior to the establishment of the first
            Brazilian national football championship in 1959. Since then, they
            have remained successful in Brazilian football, having won 7
            Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, the 1987 Copa União, 4 Copa do
            Brasil, and a record 37 Campeonato Carioca. They are one of three
            clubs to have never been relegated from the Brazilian Serie A. In
            South American and worldwide competitions, the club's highest
            achievements are their conquests of the 1981, 2019 and 2022 Copa
            Libertadores, and 1981 Intercontinental Cup against Liverpool, led
            by the club's most iconic player Zico.Flamengo's fiercest and
            longest-standing rivalries are with the other "Big Four" of Rio de
            Janeiro: Fluminense, Botafogo and Vasco da Gama. Their rivalry
            against Atlético Mineiro is considered the fiercest among all
            interstates rivalries by any clubs in the country.
          </p>
          <p>
